title: "Starcraft Deep Learning Bot"
description: "Developed an autonomous StarCraft bot using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) powered by TensorFlow and OpenCV. The AI agent processes real-time game frames to detect units, buildings, and resources, making strategic decisions with 85% accuracy in basic combat scenarios. Implemented custom computer vision algorithms for map awareness and unit control, achieving a competitive performance against medium-difficulty AI opponents in micro-battles."
