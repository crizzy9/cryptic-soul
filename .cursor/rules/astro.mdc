## Astro Authoring Rules

- Prefer Astro-native features whenever possible (layouts, islands, content collections, image component, server endpoints) before adding custom or third-party solutions.
- Prefer `Layouts` for page chrome; keep page files focused on data fetching and composition.
- Use `getStaticPaths` for dynamic routes and ensure links use the same slug logic as paths.
- Import `getCollection` and schema types from `astro:content` for type-safe content usage.
- Keep frontmatter minimal; put long logic in imported utilities.

## Content Collections

- Frontmatter must conform to schemas in [src/content/config.ts](mdc:src/content/config.ts):
  - `blog`, `project`, and `store` collections.
- `tags` must be unique within each document.
- `pubDate` should be a parseable date; prefer ISO-8601 strings.

## Slugging

- Always use [src/lib/createSlug.ts](mdc:src/lib/createSlug.ts) to generate blog URLs.
- For links: `"/blog/" + createSlug(post.data.title, post.slug)`.
- For paths: `params: { slug: createSlug(entry.data.title, entry.slug) }`.

## Styling

- Use Tailwind utility classes and DaisyUI components.
- Avoid inline styles; prefer semantic classes and extracted components.

## MD/MDX

- Keep headings and descriptions concise to power RSS and previews.
- Include `title`, `description`, and `pubDate` at minimum for `blog`.
